First Try

I cheated a bit, just due to reading the book, but for the most part I did
everything by myself.

Total time:
    Friday: 30~ minutes
    Saturday: 40~ minutes

A caveat to the timing: due to working on multiple machines, and not backing
this up previously, I started from scratch on Saturday, as opposed to continuing
my work from Friday. That being said, I had some experience working with it on
Friday.

- Started with string interpolation, and one big string.
- Moved the second sentence into it's own method, to better account for the
  different states. Hacky way, since I still use interpolation to pull in the
  second sentence
- Lots of ternary conditionals
- Used the splat to make an array from the range, so I can conditionally add a
  new line in verses
- Song was very straight forward, once everything else worked

Looking at Sandi's answer, a few things pop out:

- Using join() on verses instead of conditionally adding new lines
- String interpolation, and ternary conditionals, are very tempting
